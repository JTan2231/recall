- basic git commands--reimplementation or wrapper? I think wrapper for now
  - add
  - commit
  - push
- figuring out AI integration--where does GPT fit into this?
  - interface for identifying/updating/adding goals based on diffs
- goal list change version management--how do we drop/ignore irrelevant goals?
- I think the desired workflow out of this will be something like
  - commit changes
  - GPT proposes new set of goals based on what's changed
  - user takes and maybe edits, or leaves goals as they are
